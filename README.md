# Description
Water treatment and conditioning is an essential part of caring for any aquatic or semi-aquatic pets. However, maintaining a high-quality and uncontaminated environment to keep them healthy over long periods of time is difficult, providing a need for active water quality monitoring.
While market solutions to this problem exist, they are often either not Internet-capable or provide only rudimentary data monitoring that can be unhelpful to inexperienced fish owners.

We propose to develop a device that assesses the environment of a fish tank by observing temperature, water quality and other factors. The device may take pictures of the tank and use a recommender system to assess the images and data to make user recommendations.

## Server
The `server` directory contains all the files and source code used to run a Node.js web server.
There is a `.env` file containing the credentials for accessing the website - you are free to change the credentials to what you wish.
The website is password-protected for security purposes.

## Device
The `device` directory contains all the files and source code used to run the device.
